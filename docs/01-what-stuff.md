# What Stuff?

This section is intended to present an overview list of relevant "knowledge objects", the stuff of CHEER work.  The stuff are resources, objects, content groupings that the project team has identified as important to keep track.

## Why keep a list?

The goal is to have a cross-project understanding of things that are important to track. They are identified as important for one or more of the following reasons:

* Requirement (funder, legal, administrative, moral, ethical)
* Collective project memory and history
* Make on-boarding new team members easier
* Facilitate cross-project collective understandings
* Make project life easier

## What is on the list?

The most basic items on the list are:
* Data
* Code
* Presentations
* Publications
* Procedures and Checklists
* Meeting agendas / notes
